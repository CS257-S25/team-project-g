# Team Contract

### Goals Statement
Our goals as a team include to work together towards a shared vision for our 
project, and learn how to navigate a shared codebase with Git and a database.

### Strengths
- Cooper: Debugging, patient
- Devin: Experience with HTML/CSS, open-minded
- Marco: Data structures, patience
- Joe: Data structures, patience

### Capitalizing on Strengths
We will capitalize on our strengths by dividing and distributing tasks 
(kanban), assigning roles if necessary.

## Rules
- **Meetings:** We will meet in person. Meetings will regularly take place in 
CMC 109, and each subsequent meeting will be scheduled during the prior 
meeting. We’ll plan to finish meetings by 10 PM, with a hard cap at midnight 
(except in the case of deadline sprints).
- **Roles:** Although we’re not planning to take specific roles in the CS 
project, we plan on having rotating meeting roles (ie note-takers). Marco will 
send out GCal invites for all of our meetings.
- **Communication:** We have a group chat we will use for all communication, 
including planning meetings, absence/sickness notifications, and other updates. 
If there’s a failure to communicate, we’ll handle it in class in-person.
- **Technologies:** We will use Google Calendar to schedule our meetings, Marco 
sending invites for each one. We will not use remote meeting technology, unless 
someone is sick or unable to attend physically for whatever reason. We will 
have a shared Google Drive folder with any non-Git stuff we accumulate (meeting 
notes, etc)
- **Decision-Making:** Decisions will be made by unanimous consensus and/or 
compromise whenever possible. Majority consensus (3-1) will be used only if 
necessary.
- **Delegation:** We’ll use GitHub project boards (or some other 
trello/kanban system) to assign tasks to ourselves and finish tasks on time. 
We’ll talk these over during our meetings whenever possible, to make sure 
each member is contributing equally and in a way that they feel is valued by 
the entire team.
- **Conflict Resolution:** We’re nice people, we’ll talk it out. If 
necessary, a little public shaming during class time will ensue. This 
shouldn’t be a problem.
