# Project Proposal

### Working Title
The Forbidden Library

### Summary
We are primarily working with a database on banned books from PEN America. This database includes variables on Title, Author, State, District, Date of Challenge, Ban Status, and Instantiating Action. Additionally, we will be comparing this to another database using information from Goodreads. This database has information of genre, description, rating and much more information on each book.
