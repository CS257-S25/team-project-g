## Usability Principles

### Scanability
Our website uses clear headings, concise labels, and organized layouts to help users quickly find relevant information. Search results and data tables are formatted for easy scanning, allowing users to identify key details at a glance.

### Satisficing
We provide straightforward search and filter options so users can efficiently get useful results without needing to explore every feature. The interface is designed to help users accomplish their goals with minimal effort.

### Muddling Through
The navigation and controls are forgiving, allowing users to try different searches or filters without penalty. Users can experiment with commands and options, learning the system as they go, and easily recover from mistakes.
