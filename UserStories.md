As a reader, I can search for books by title, author, and/or genre, so that I can see what types of books have been banned in specific categories.
- Able to search by title/author/genre
- Display author/book cover/genre/rating/ban status/summary/rating
    - This is primarily for the website, for the command line functionality, title, author, and isbn are displayed
- If the book is not found the user sees “No results found”

As a researcher, I can get the top X books/states by number of bans, so I can see who/what is most affected by book bans.
- Able to choose a book/author/state/
- Displays subcategory in a sorted list by number of bans (Ex: if author is chosen, display banned authors in a sorted order)
- Displays number of bans for each subcategory
