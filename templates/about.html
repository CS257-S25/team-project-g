    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p>
        The <strong>Banned Books Tracker</strong> is a web application that visualizes and explores book bans across the United States. 
        This project was created to support transparency and raise awareness about censorship in literature, particularly within schools and libraries.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Banning books often reflects deeper societal struggles—around race, identity, sexuality, and power. 
        This website allows users to browse banned books, explore maps showing where bans occur most, and view statistics about 
        which authors and titles are most frequently challenged.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>📚 View the most frequently banned books, authors, and genres</li>
        <li>🗺️ Interactive maps showing state- and district-level bans</li>
        <li>🔍 Search by title, author, ISBN, or genre</li>
        <li>📊 Command-line interface for data queries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>This project is built using the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flask</strong> – Web application framework for routing and rendering</li>
        <li><strong>Python</strong> – Core logic for data handling and API endpoints</li>
        <li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong> – Front-end templating</li>
        <li><strong>CLI Interface</strong> – Command-line tool built in <code>cl.py</code> for data extraction</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Source Code Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>app.py</code>: Flask app with routes for books, maps, genres, and API endpoints.</li>
        <li><code>cl.py</code>: A command-line tool to search for titles, authors, genres, and view most banned data.</li>
        <li><code>most_banned.py</code>: Custom logic for formatting and filtering the most banned books by various categories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Censorship of literature affects education, identity formation, and cultural literacy. 
        Our goal is to empower users—students, educators, parents, and activists—with access to transparent and up-to-date information about banned books.
